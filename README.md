BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

Preprocessing is necessary to prepare picture data for model input. For example, the
convolutional neural networks fully connected layers it is favored that all the
images must be in the arrays which are of the same size.

PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES

The sole purpose of pre-processing is raise the image quality so that we can analyze
it more effectively. It allows us to eliminate distortions and improve specific
qualities that are crucial for the task. Preprocessing includes adjustments to the size,
orientation, and color but is not limited to it. These characteristics change
depending on the application
